This is a small application using the Visual Studio environment and created using the Windows Forms App template and coded using the .NET 6.0 framework.

The goal of this application was to create a application that allows user to add/modify/delete parts to a list that are displayed in a grid
then users can use those parts to create products which they can also add/modify/delete and view via a grid.
The parts and products lists keep track of id,name,price,stock,min stock,max stock, and include search functionality via the part or product ID.
The Application also includes several validation checks to make sure parts and products are updated or added correctly.
